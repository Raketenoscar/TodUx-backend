- **Todo Management**: Create, read, update, and delete todos
- **User Profiles**: Manage user information with email verification
- **Secure Passwords**: Hashed Passwords using bcryptjs before storage
- **Security**: ArcJet integration for rate limiting and abuse prevention
- **MongoDB Integration**: Reliable data persistence with Mongoose ODM
- **Timestamps**: Automatic creation and modification timestamps on all resources
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages that help identify and resolve issues quickly
